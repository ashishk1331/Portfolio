						Experimental Engineer
					</h2>

					<p>
						Currently, I'm studying about compilers and parsers.
						Also, I picked up Rust to write any of them. It will be
						my 4th programming language, after Java, Python and
						Javascript. So far, it's been astounding and the
						constructs it supports bring up a smile on my face. I'm
						trying to write a markdown parser in Rust to help
						frameworks like Astro with markdown and faster build
						times.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've also studied React as a framework, including hooks
						implementations, UI patterns and JSX transformations. I
						want to share that beneath every abstraction React is
						all functions. So, think of it as messed up JS and
						nothing more!
					</p>
					<p>
						For the web apps, I use NextJS, Tailwind CSS and
						Supabase. I am a "Fully Frontend Developer". I also know
						Zustand, Formik, Framer, RTL, Goober and many more
						libraries.

					<p>
						I adore the concept of VDOM and, hence, React. So, I
						went on a journey of studying more about how React works
						under the hood and how magic happens. It is the widely
						adopted use case of Trees, the data structure. I'm
						impressed.

						<mark>#</mark>I live on trees
					</h2>

					<p>
						Indeed, leaving weed aside, I live on trees. Whether
						AVLs or RBs, I love them all. Generally, I solve
						questions on leetcode and have interest for problems
						hosted in events like advent of code.
					</p>

					<p>
						Although, I learnt Rust but it seems a bit intimidating
						so for most of the times I start sketching with Python.
						I've spent around 2 years writing Python so it is my
						second language after Hindi. However, I've pledged to
						write as much as possible Rust. Best way to do something
						is to start doing it, isn't it?
					</p>

					<p>
						Advent of code is my favourite competition for coding
						problems, and this year it got even more tough. I
						recommend coders to try it out!

						Design is the first thing that a user sees and it is the

						I'm trying to learn more about it.

						These are some of the webpages that I've built. I've

						Testing Library for testing the components.

					<p>
						These also includes the redesign of few webapges that I
						came across. The whole purpose is to improve site
