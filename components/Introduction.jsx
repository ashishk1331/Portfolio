				:waving-hand: Hello everyone! Iâ€™m Ashish Khare, a indie web
				developer and designer based in India. I usually love studying
				topics realted to data structures like the almighty virtual DOM.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm that night owl who tweets as well. Personally, I enjoy
				Twitter not only becasue of the great people that reside there
				but also becasue it has a great User Experience, features
				unparallel to any other social site and ofcourse the
				"controversy". :wink:
			</p>
			<p>And yes! I deliberately left out the dark mode. :evil-laugh:</p>
