Sometimes all you need is to pass children and render them elegantly. Why do I need extra type definitions and JSX insertion for plain JavaScript when I'm already writing tags using JSX? Why this question, though? For the past few months, I've been using [Astro](https://astro.build/) to build practically everything.

If you are unable to understand me, think of HOCs in react.

- Increased complexity
- But gives better programming flexibility like conditional rendering.
